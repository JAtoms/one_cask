      "nose": "This is the classic ‘ahhh’ moment for most wine drinkers. While the wine may be completely dry, the finish has a note of softness and elegance to it.",
      "palate": "This wine will taste more tart or bitter on the finish. It may have some green notes to it, but on a good quality wine, the acidity will tingle and persist, giving the wine a delicate, mouthwatering long finish.",
      "finish": "The wine words ‘juicy’ and ‘fresh’ often indicate a wine that has a lot of just-ripe fruit flavors on the finish, usually found on young wines from moderate climates."
